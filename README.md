Wine Quality Prediction Model
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether the wine is of good or bad quality based on 11 physicochemical features (without including 'quality'). The model is trained using a RandomForestClassifier and deployed using Streamlit.

Features
Predicts the quality of red wine as either good or bad.
Takes 11 input features and provides a prediction.
The machine learning model is built using the RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn.
The web interface is created using Streamlit.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Wine Quality Dataset, which contains the following features:

Fixed Acidity
Volatile Acidity
Citric Acid
Residual Sugar
Chlorides
Free Sulfur Dioxide
Total Sulfur Dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Quality (Target variable)
The target variable (quality) is categorized into:

Good Quality: Wine with a quality score of 7 or above.
Bad Quality: Wine with a quality score of less than 7.
The model will use the other 11 features (excluding 'quality') to predict if the wine is good or bad.

How to Use
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from here.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-prediction.git
cd wine-quality-prediction
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Here's how you can do that:

For Windows:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Run the Web Application
To run the web app, simply use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will start a local server and display the web interface for the wine quality prediction model.

Step 5: Input Features
On the web interface, you'll need to input the 11 physicochemical features (excluding 'quality') as a comma-separated string. For example:

Copy code
7.4,0.7,0,1.9,0.076,11,34,0.9978,3.51,0.56,9.4
These values correspond to the following features:

Fixed Acidity
Volatile Acidity
Citric Acid
Residual Sugar
Chlorides
Free Sulfur Dioxide
Total Sulfur Dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Once you input the features, the model will predict if the wine is of Good Quality or Bad Quality.

Step 6: View Prediction
The model will output either:

Good Quality Wine if the wine's predicted quality is 7 or more.
Bad Quality Wine otherwise.
Example
Suppose you input the following values:

Copy code
7.4,0.7,0,1.9,0.076,11,34,0.9978,3.51,0.56,9.4
The model might predict:

Copy code
Good Quality Wine
